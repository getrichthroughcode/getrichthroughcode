## 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Abdoulaye Diallo** — originally from **Guinea Conakry**, a small yet vibrant country in West Africa. I completed my early education there before moving to **France** to pursue higher studies.

I began my journey in **Orléans**, where I enrolled in a **Preparatory Class (Math-Physics-Computer Science track)**—a rigorous program designed to enter France’s elite engineering schools, the *Grandes Écoles*. My efforts led me to **ENSEIRB-MATMECA**, a top-tier engineering school in **Talence**, specializing in **electrical and computer engineering** and consistently ranked **A+** among French engineering institutions.

At ENSEIRB-MATMECA, I specialized in:
- ⚡ **Electrical Engineering & Analog Electronics** (RF, circuit design, transistors)
- 🧠 **Embedded Systems** (microcontrollers, FPGA, Raspberry Pi)
- 🖼️ **Signal & Image Processing** (image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, pattern recognition, and AI for edge devices)

This is where my passion for **computer vision** and **AI-driven signal processing** truly took shape. I'm set to graduate in **September 2025**.

Along the way, I’ve had the chance to gain **hands-on industry experience**:
- 🚀 At startups, I built and deployed **LLM-powered resume parsers and analyzers**
- 🏙️ At larger companies, I worked as an **R&D intern**, developing **object trackers** for **smart city projects**

Outside of tech, I’m just a laid-back guy who enjoys:
- 📸 **Photography**
- ⚽ **Football (Soccer)**
- 🏀 **Basketball**

Let’s connect and build something cool together!
